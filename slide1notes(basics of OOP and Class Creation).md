#Object Oriented programming

focuses on the defenition of the object rather than procedures to solve problems

OOP focuses the manipulation of the objects data rather than logic to manipulate them

#Analysis if an object

combination of data and code that
States: The character
Behaviour: Functionality of the object (What it can do)
Objects data: Attributes
Objects Codes: Methods

#Classes
A class contains attributes which are an objects accessible tools
Fields: Belongs to instance of class or belongs to the class itself
Methods: Functions that the object can call

Classes can have methods

#Methods

the __init__(self) method is executed as soon as the objects class is initiated. It helps us initialize the object attributes the self parameter is used so that it can be accessible to itself. It will also treat its attributes as local
